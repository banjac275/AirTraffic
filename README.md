# AirTraffic FE Test v1.0

This mini project is a job test project done in a relatively short time. It is to show skills that one might have, or at least posseses basic ones for dealing with front-end.

<h3>What does it do?</h3>

Firstly, it asks user for location, if the location is not provided the app will not work and the message will pop-up. So, you allow your location and almost immediately flight information of all airbourne planes will show on screen. There are four fields in the table: ordinal number of the plane, where is it bound to (east - airplane icon is slightly to the right, west - icon is slightly to the left), how high the plane is (in feet), flight number. If one wants to know more about flight, all he/she needs to do is to click on the desired flight and gain information. When the info box shows, you receive following information: airplane manufacturer and model, flight origin and destination, and the airline logo(if logo is not present, insetead of picture is airline name present).

<h3>What can be done more?</h3>

Probably the hight can be transfered to meters, if one desires, but I left it at feet, because most airlines count it that way and also, I think, that when you fly captain says how high are you in feet. The system do obtain logos can be better, but the logo API works only with domains of companies, so that would require using stuff from node.js interpreter as the company name to domain API works only with node.js and a couple other languages, with which I don't know how to do with, and for plain js there was no support that I could find. There can also be added a link to the airline when you click on the logo, as well as the links to the airports arrivals and departures. And of course, there can be added a map on the info page which can show a flight pattern and current location on map.

<h3>Technical details</h3>

App was made with PHPStorm 2017.1, all with Vanilla JS, no additional frameworks inserted. Can run on any computer or device, is responsive.

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

Very nice little project, done with great joy. A lot can be added, but that is for another time.
